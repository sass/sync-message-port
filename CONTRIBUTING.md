# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

* [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement)
* [Code Reviews](#code-reviews)
* [Large Language Models](#large-language-models)

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Large Language Models

Do not submit any code or prose written or modified by large language models or
"artificial intelligence" such as GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to this project.
These tools produce code that looks plausible, which means that not only is it
likely to contain bugs those bugs are likely to be difficult to notice on
review. In addition, because these models were trained indiscriminately and
non-consensually on open-source code with a variety of licenses, it's not
obvious that we have the moral or legal right to redistribute code they
generate.
